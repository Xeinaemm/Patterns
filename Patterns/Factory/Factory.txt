- Separate object creation from the decision of which object to create
- Not breaking OCP
- Store which object to create outside of the program

Factory method:
- Adds an interface to the factory itself from simple Factory
- Defers object creation to multiple factories that share an interface
- Derived classes implement or override the factory method of the base
- Eliminate references to concrete classes
- Factories can be inherited to provide even more specialized object creation
- Rules of object initialization is centralized
- May need to create a factory just to get a concrete class delivered
- The inheritance hierarchy gets deeper with coupling between concrete factories
	and created classes

Abstract Factory:
- Factories create different types of concrete objects
- A factory now represents a group of objects that it can create
- Factories may have more than one factory method
