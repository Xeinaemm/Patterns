- The iterator pattern defines interfaces for the aggregate(IEnumerable) and 
	the iterator(IEnumerator), each of which must be implemented for each 
	collection that is to support the pattern.
- Use when need to traverse a collection
- Want to abstract the collection iteration logic
- Don't whish to break encapsulation and expose collections globally
- By separating iteration form the aggregate itself, more than one traversal
	operation can occur at the same time.
