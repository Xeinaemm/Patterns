- Receiver is aware of only one handler
- Each handler is only aware of the next handler
- Handlers process the message or send it ot the next handler
- The Receiver doesn't know who handled the message
- The first handler to process the message terminates the chain
- The order of the handler list matters

Use when:
- More than one message handler for a message
- The appropriate handler isn't explicitly known by the sender
- The set of handlers can be dybamically defined
