- A specification defines a method or predicate that matches qualifying objects
- Separate the specification of the work from performing the work itself
- Is generally used for validation, filtering, or build-toorder scenarios


Predicates:
- Rules that evaluate to a Boolean can be modeled as predicats
- Rules can use Func<T,bool> or Expression<Func<T,bool>>
- Work best for simple, small conditions.
